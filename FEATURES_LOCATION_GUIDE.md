## 💡 Recommendation

**Current Setup (Recommended):**
- **Android App** = Simple NFC writer (perfect for "tap to write")
- **Web Dashboard** = Full tag management (all features)

This is actually ideal because:
- ✅ Quick NFC writing on the go
- ✅ Full management on desktop/web
- ✅ Simple app = faster, easier to use
- ✅ Web = more features, better for complex tasks

**But if you want**, I can add more features to the Android app! Just let me know which ones.
